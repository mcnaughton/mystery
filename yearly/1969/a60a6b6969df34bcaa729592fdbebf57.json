Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. \"My example is drugtreatment.\"Beyond the controversy over specific projects and the fiscal choices, there isdisagreement over what role, if any, government should play in the culture.Alexander said the NEA serves as an \"imprimatur of excellence\" - providingprivate donors a quality guide for which artists and art deserves support.Bennett said that is exactly what is wrong - that the \"fundamental problem\"is that \"government becomes the accrediting agency for the arts andhumanities.\"This cultural clash is unlikely to end for at least several months. TheEndowments haven't been formally reauthorized since 1993, but funds wereprovided on a year-to-year basis. Livingston said that won't happen again -the Endowments will have to be reauthorized to receive any funding.The chairman of the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Endowments,Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, predicted that the House would eliminate fundingfor the Endowments but that the Senate would include some money in its budget.The future of the agencies would then be determined in conference committee.Even supporters believe Congress will impose changes.\"Business as usual will no longer suffice,\" warned Sen. Nancy Kassebaum,R-Kan., chairman of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over the Endowmentsand a key supporter of their continued existence.\"All options are on the table - including eliminating the NEA, privatizingthe NEA, sending funds to states in block grants, restructuring the endowmentand its operations, maintaining the current structure with changes in theendowment's administrative and grant-making procedures, and maintaining thestatus quo.\""},"updated":1423900992}
