The car will allow Nevarez to drive to school from Woodland (a difficult feat by bike).\r\n\nThe Focus is a mid-size comfortable family sedan, Ford's latest proteg\u00e9. It combines safety, styling, affordability and fuel economy into one unique package, and is loaded with standard features.\r\n\nDavis 411.com features information on 900 Davis businesses, including movie showtimes and listings, restaurant menus, prices, pictures, hours of operation, classified ads, upcoming events and more. \r\n\nThe new company will continue giving prizes away throughout the year.\r\n\nFor more information, visit the company's Web site at www.411.com."},"updated":1424238575}
