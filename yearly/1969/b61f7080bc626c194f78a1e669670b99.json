The program allows certain minor non-violent offenders the opportunity to continue working at their jobs while reporting back to the jail at day's end where they spend their nights and weekends in custody.\r\n\nBy the time Oldwin's client was sentenced in early February, the Sheriff's department had resumed a work furlough option for women, previously eliminated due to staffing and budget constraints on the Sheriff's department.\r\n\nMeyi was sentenced to 90 days in jail by Judge Harry Kinnicutt.  Because she was already in the electronic monitoring program, Kinnicutt's imposition of another interim but less stringent sentence than straight jail time, will likely enable Meyi to continue  earning an income.\r\n\nThis is an important part of your life, Kinnicutt  told Meyi. \"You can do the right thing or the wrong thing.  You do the wrong thing and I'll lock you up.\""},"updated":1424234742}
